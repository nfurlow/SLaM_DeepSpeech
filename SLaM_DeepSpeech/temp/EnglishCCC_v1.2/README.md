English Consistent Confusion Corpus
===

Overview
---
The English Consistent Confusion Corpus is a large-scale collection of noise induced British English speech misperceptions. These misperceptions have been elicited  by asking listeners to transcribe English words mixed with complex noise backgrounds. The corpus has been distilled from over 300,000 listener responses and includes responses to over 9,000 individual noisy speech tokens. Of these, a subset of over 3,000 tokens induce 'consistent confusions', i.e. they are misheard in the same way by a significant number of listeners.
 
The corpus design and structure is based on the design of an original [Spanish confusion corpus](http://laslab.org/resources/confusions/). Further information -- including a full description of the corpus elicitation -- is available at [http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/confusion_corpus/](http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/confusion_corpus/)

Structure
---
The corpus consists of three main elements:

  - confusionCorpus_*.csv: CSV file containing all the information of the confusions
  - maskerWavs: folder containing masker waveforms from which the masker segments were chosen for any given confusion
  - confusionWavs: folder containing all the waveforms needed to reconstruct the stimuli which generated interesting confusions
